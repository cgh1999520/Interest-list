ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .idea\
* .idea\codeStyles\
* .idea\codeStyles\Project.xml
* .idea\misc.xml
* .idea\modules.xml
* .idea\workspace.xml
* .idea\趣清单.iml
* proguard.cfg

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => app\src\main\assets
* libs\Bmob_Push_V0.6beta_20150408.jar => app\libs\Bmob_Push_V0.6beta_20150408.jar
* libs\BmobSDK_V3.4.6_0415.jar => app\libs\BmobSDK_V3.4.6_0415.jar
* libs\hyphenatechat_3.1.2.jar => app\libs\hyphenatechat_3.1.2.jar
* libs\okhttp-2.4.0.jar => app\libs\okhttp-2.4.0.jar
* libs\okio-1.4.0.jar => app\libs\okio-1.4.0.jar
* libs\xUtils-2.6.14.jar => app\libs\xUtils-2.6.14.jar
* lint.xml => app\lint.xml
* res\ => app\src\main\res\
* src\ => app\src\main\java\
* main_rb_fenge.PNG => main_rb_fenge.png

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
